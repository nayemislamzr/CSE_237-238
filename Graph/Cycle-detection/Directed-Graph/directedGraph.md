#### Cycle Detection in Directed Graph :

DFS can be used to detect cycle in a directed graph.
DFS in a conneced graph produces a tree. There is a cycle in a undirected Graph if there is a **Back Edge** present in the graph. Backedge is an edge that is from a node to itself or one of its ancestors (direct parent, undirect parent).
